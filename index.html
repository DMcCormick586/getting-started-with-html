  <!--
Putting this in here for now since I don't know how to make notes on code without it thinking it was a code.
That is whay in the notes you do see i put a space after the < to make it not think it is a code.

<b>HTML</b> – Hypertext Markup Launguage<br>
They are either inline or block. Block elements form an invisible block around what's inside of them. 
Here is a refresher <em><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">video</a></em> on HTML

<b>1 - What a Web Page is?</b><br>
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.<br><br>
<b>2 - How Coding Works</b><br>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
<br>I'm < b> learning < /b> to code!<br>
look like this:<br>
I'm <b>learning to code!</b>
<br><br>
<b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b><br>
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
For example, if you forget to close a < b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.
